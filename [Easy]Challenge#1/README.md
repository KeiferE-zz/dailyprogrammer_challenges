Reddit Challenge [easy] #1:

create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. have it tell them the information back, in the format:
your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)
for extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later.

***Extra***

-added error handling for name, age, username input format

-added abilty to check and redo input before write to file occurs

-stores all user information collected in redditdata.txt
